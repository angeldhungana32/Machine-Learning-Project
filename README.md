# Machine-Learning-Project
This is developed and maintained by Angel Dhungana and William Gerichs for CS5350/6350 Final Project in University of Utah. We will be using various Machine Learning Techniques to explore/solve research or practical problems. We will be running a Sentimental Analysis using various classifiers and models on Yelp dataset, particularly User Reviews. We want to detemine which model or classfier gives more accuracy.
